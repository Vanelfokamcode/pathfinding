# pathfinding
pathfinding Game using Priority Queue with python
game which take two node the start node and the end and try to find the shortest path between them
we use the manhattan distance 
f_score = g_score + h_score 
we first set the g_score and f_score to infinity 
g_node = node away from the start
f_node = how we are from the target 
so what we trying to do is to find the lowest f_node
